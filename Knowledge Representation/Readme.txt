Instructions for running the Prolog program

1. Open the prolog file (Axioms.pl) and extract the file to the desktop.
2. On the command line interface, retrieve the path for the working directory where the prolog file is saved.
    For Mac or Linux computers use:-
    1. cd desktop
    2. pwd
    For Windows computers
    1. cd desktop
    2. chdir
3. Have installed SWI prolog application on the computer.
4. Open prolog, and type in the following command to compile the prolog file:
    Below is an example used on my computer:
    ['/Users/samarthsairam/desktop/Axioms.pl']
  Generalized as:
  ['Working_directory/filename.pl'] & then click enter and press full stop(.) .

 Once the file has been compiled use the predicates and key in the appropriate variable names.
    Example :- person(John) where,
    John is a variable and person is the predicate.
6. Output is shown in terms of true/false, where 'true' indicates 'yes' and 'false' indicates 'No'.
